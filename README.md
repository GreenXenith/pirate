# Pirate Things #
(Scurvy not included)   

Features (by enabled dependency):  
* `default`: Swords and other tools  
* `shooter` (by stu): Guns  
* `3d_armor` (by stu): Wearables  

A lot of items were taken out of an abandoned game I made years ago, so not all of the textures look great.  
I may redo some later.  

TODO:
* Boots
* Compass
* Other things?  

NOTE: Wearable attachments might appear lagged behind in 5.1.0, this is fixed in later Minetest versions.
